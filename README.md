# Algorithms and Data Structures
A collection of custom implementation of common data-structures, algorithms, and various related tasks

## Lists, Hash tables, etc
- anagram check
- finding unique pairs of integers in array which sum is equal to a given number
- check if given string contains only unique characters
- various sorting algorithms: shell, merge, quick, insertion, selection, bubble

## Stacks and Queues
- stack with O(1) time to get max value
- queue with O(1) time to get max value
- queue from 2 stacks
- check parenthesis for balance

## Graphs

## Trees

## Helper objects and methods:
- generation of a random array
- execution time measure tools
- verifier for sorting algorithms
