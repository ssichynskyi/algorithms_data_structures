"""FIND THE MISSING ELEMENT

Problem:
    Consider an array of non-negative integers.
    A second array is formed by shuffling the elements of the first array and deleting a random element.
    Given these two arrays, find which element is missing in the second array.

Example:
    Input:
    finder([1,2,3,4,5,6,7],[3,7,2,1,4,6]) #number 5 was removed after shuffling

    Output:
    5 is the missing number
