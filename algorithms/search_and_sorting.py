    Idea:
        it's similar to insertion sort, but with the feature of
        selecting several sub-arrays (sorted)
        "Sub-array" is just a virtual array of elements that has the same distance
        between their indexes.
        For example: [15, 26, 71, 1, 16, 83, 42, 29] with distance == 3 will select
        following virtual arrays and sort them:
        1: [15, 1, 42]
        2: [26, 16, 29]
        3: [71, 83]
        Then it will exchange their positions like if these small lists are sorted:
        1: [1, 15, 42]
        2: [16, 26, 29]
        3: [71, 83]
        So, the end list will look like:
        [1, 16, 71, 15, 26, 83, 42, 29]
        Next step is to reduce the distance and repeat the process.
        The last stage is a simple insertion sort

    Note:
        implemented here is the binary one (not the most effective though)
        Time complexity varies from O(n*log(n)) to O(n*(log(n))^2) for optimized modifications
        Which makes it quite an effective algorithm from those that has O(1) memory complexity
        Although this implementation looks as if it has high time complexity because of 4 nested loops,
        it provides the expected performance of ~ n*log(n). According to measurements the execution time
        is increased by factor ~ 230 when n is increased 100 times. The reason is that all nested loops
        has time complexity less than O(N), mostly log(N)

        binary heap is a complete binary tree (filled with no spaces),

        Some data:
            [14, 12, 10, 8, 5, 9, 4] - is a way to store the BH
            if current node has index i, then it's leaves (child) node indexes are:
            left = 2*i + 1
            right = 2*i + 2
            The index of the last node with children is therefore = (n - 1s) // 2,
            where n is the last index of the bin-heap list (e.g. len(array) - 1)
        This algorithm has a constant time performance N*log(N) and O(1) space performance

    Idea:
        Take the last node with leaves (children) and apply heapify on it.
        Heapify is a process of bringing the elements below the current node
        into the binary heap order (parent node > child nodes)
        Repeat the process by moving left in the heap array.

        array: array to sort

        None, all changes are done directly in a given array
